# Under-the-Sea
Developed a seafood restaurant management system that enables users to browse a seafood menu, place orders, and view prices. I was primarily responsible for programming the application using Java, handling the core logic and user interaction. The project was developed as part of a team, focusing on applying object-oriented programming concepts.
